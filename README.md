# Molecular Orbitals

**Real-Time Visualization of Molecular Orbital Formation using LCAO and OpenGL Shaders**

## Overview

This project demonstrates the quantum mechanical formation of **molecular orbitals** using the **Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO)** method. It provides an interactive, real-time visualization powered by **OpenGL shaders**, making abstract quantum phenomena both intuitive and visually compelling.

## Features

- 🧪 **LCAO-based Orbital Formation**: Simulates constructive and destructive interference of atomic orbitals.
- 🎮 **Real-Time Interaction**: Modify atomic positions and orbital parameters on-the-fly.
- 🔬 **Shader-Based Rendering**: GPU computation using GLSL for smooth and continuous orbital visualizations.
- 📈 **Live Calculations**: Computes electron densities, nodal planes, and bonding/antibonding regions in real time.

## Visualization Goals

- Illustrate bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.
- Show how atomic orbitals overlap and combine.
- Represent nodal structures and phase changes.

## Technologies Used

- **C++** with **OpenGL** for core graphics engine.
- **GLSL** (OpenGL Shading Language) for orbital field rendering.
- **ImGui** for user interface and real-time parameter tweaks. (yet to implement)
